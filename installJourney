Welp Manjaro being Manjaro hasn't pre-installed the necessary network, audio drivers. 
So let's do it.

$$ First problem - Network.
Check if the Kernel is LTS. 
Install the kernel headers.
Find out a good repo that maintains these drivers for your Chipset.
For my HP Victus it was - https://github.com/lwfinger/rtw89
Followed it and fixed the wifi issue.

$$ Second problem - Sound
Install pulseaudio, pavucontrol.

Now adding ssh keys for diffrent accounts.
Configuring git 

Cloning the git bare repo for dotfiles.
    refer :  https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

# To stop tracking off all the files in home directory : 
  config config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no

Installed Code OS from Package Manager
By default code looks for extension only on store, so change the marketplace URLs in product.json to the official sites

$$  Bluetooth
Blueman seems the most organized bluetooth manager
Follow this : https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Blueman

Install pulseadudio-bluetooth to link pulseaudio with bluetooth headsets.

Craziest of all xD  ( Tried a bunch of bluetooth managers before it xD )

$$ Setting up pass (gpg key, pass stores on laptop, mobile)

refer for setup 1st time (not req again though) :  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVkURNfxPd4
for setting it up on new  system :  https://gist.github.com/abtrout/d64fb11ad6f9f49fa325

    for mobile : use openkeychain for gpg management
                 and password store ( available on fdroid and it's website if not on playstore)
